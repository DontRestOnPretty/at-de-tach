A drag and drop text manipulator.

### Tactile Digital Editing

The dream back in 2006 when I first saw a multi-touch screen was the ability to
quickly separate and reattach blocks of text based on simple rules, like whether
they were inside or outside of braces, or being able to manually select/hightlight
text which could then be dragged to copy or move it to a new file or position.
I felt that boilerplate code and code snippets could then be supercharged by a
human interface that allowed physically intuitive editing and a much shorter
physical distance to complete the same task. Even using a mouse, dragging and
dropping to copy/insert/append/remove text is faster, simpler, and more visually
intuitive than keyboard shortcuts, key combinations, or plain ol' typing a bunch
of characters to navigate or input text.

The two main functions would be 
1) split a text string into two separate strings based on cursor position, and 
2) append or insert text by dragging it over another string and dropping it.

Additional functions are basic UI features like adding OS files by drag and drop,
undo/redo, fonts/themes customization, gestures to select/highlight: like circling
a group of string object to combine them, and more etc.
